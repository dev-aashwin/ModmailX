üìù 3. FAQ / Troubleshooting
# FAQ / Troubleshooting

## Why isn‚Äôt the bot responding?
- Make sure the bot is invited with **application.commands** and **moderation permissions**.
- Check that your token in `.env` is valid.

## Database errors (Prisma)
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
- Run:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy

Logs not appearing

Check that you have set the log channel with /config set logchannel.

Ensure the bot has permission to send messages in that channel.

Bot keeps going offline

If running locally, keep the terminal open.

For production, use PM2 or Docker to keep the process alive.
